With care an attacker can cause exec_id\nwrap and send arbitrary signals to a newly exec'd parent.  This\nbypasses the signal sending checks if the parent changes their\ncredentials during exec.\n\nThe severity of this problem can been seen that in my limited testing\nof a 32bit exec_id it can take as little as 19s to exec 65536 times.\nWhich means that it can take as little as 14 days to wrap a 32bit\nexec_id.  Adam Zabrocki has succeeded wrapping the self_exe_id in 7\ndays.  Even my slower timing is in the uptime of a typical server.\nWhich means self_exec_id is simply a speed bump today, and if exec\ngets noticably faster self_exec_id won't even be a speed bump.\n\nExtending self_exec_id to 64bits introduces a problem on 32bit\narchitectures where reading self_exec_id is no longer atomic and can\ntake two read instructions.  Which means that is is possible to hit\na window where the read value of exec_id does not match the written\nvalue.  So with very lucky timing after this change this still\nremains expoiltable.\n\nI have updated the update of exec_id on exec to use WRITE_ONCE\nand the read of exec_id in do_notify_parent to use READ_ONCE\nto make it clear that there is no locking between these two\nlocations.\n\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/kernel-hardening/20200324215049.GA3710@pi3.com.pl\nFixes: 2.3.23pre2\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: \"Eric W.

INT_MAX is an indicator for user space that the\noverrun value has been clamped.\n\nReported-by: Team OWL337 <icytxw@gmail.com>\nSigned-off-by: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>\nAcked-by: John Stultz <john.stultz@linaro.org>\nCc: Peter Zijlstra <peterz@infradead.org>\nCc: Michael Kerrisk <mtk.manpages@gmail.com>\nLink: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20180626132705.018623573@linutronix.de",

The first is that the code does not check if the control is actually a\nuser control and neither does it check if the control is owned by the process\nthat tries to remove it. That allows userspace applications to remove arbitrary\ncontrols, which can cause a user after free if a for example a driver does not\nexpect a control to be removed from under its feed.\n\nThe second issue is that on one hand when a control is replaced the\nuser_ctl_count limit is not checked and on the other hand the user_ctl_count is\nincreased (even though the number of user controls does not change). This allows\nuserspace, once the user_ctl_count limit as been reached, to repeatedly replace\na control until user_ctl_count overflows. Once that happens new controls can be\nadded effectively bypassing the user_ctl_count limit.\n\nBoth issues can be fixed by instead of open-coding the removal of the control\nthat is to be replaced to use snd_ctl_remove_user_ctl(). This function does\nproper permission checks as well as decrements user_ctl_count after the control\nhas been removed.\n\nNote that by using snd_ctl_remove_user_ctl() the check which returns -EBUSY at\nbeginning of the function if the control already exists is removed. This is not\na problem though since the check is quite useless, because the lock that is\nprotecting the control list is released between the check and before adding the\nnew control to the list, which means that it is possible that a different\ncontrol with the same settings is added to the list after the check. Luckily\nthere is another check that is done while holding the lock in snd_ctl_add(), so\nwe'll rely on that to make sure that the same control is not added twice.\n\nSigned-off-by: Lars-Peter Clausen <lars@metafoo.de>\nAcked-by: Jaroslav Kysela <perex@perex.cz>\nCc: <stable@vger.kernel.org>\nSigned-off-by: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>",

This was introduced by\ncommit\n\nf755a04 oom: use pte pages in OOM score\n\nwhere the oom score computation was divided into several steps and it's no\nlonger computed as one expression in unsigned long(rss, swapents, nr_pte\nare unsigned long), where the result value assigned to points(int) is in\nrange(1..1000).  So there could be an int overflow while computing\n\n176          points *= 1000;\n\nand points may have negative value. Meaning the oom score for a mem hog task\nwill be one.\n\n196          if (points <= 0)\n197                  return 1;\n\nFor example:\n[ 3366]     0  3366 35390480 24303939   5       0             0 oom01\nOut of memory: Kill process 3366 (oom01) score 1 or sacrifice child\n\nHere the oom1 process consumes more than 24303939(rss)*4096~=92GB physical\nmemory, but it's oom score is one.\n\nIn this situation the mem hog task is skipped and oom killer kills another and\nmost probably innocent task with oom score greater than one.\n\nThe points variable should be of type long instead of int to prevent the\nint overflow.\n\nSigned-off-by: Frantisek Hrbata <fhrbata@redhat.com>\nAcked-by: KOSAKI Motohiro <kosaki.motohiro@jp.fujitsu.com>\nAcked-by: Oleg Nesterov <oleg@redhat.com>\nAcked-by: David Rientjes <rientjes@google.com>\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>",

Re-implement the nfc_llcp_find_local(). The current version does not\ngrab the reference when getting the local from the linked list.  For\nexample, the llcp_sock_bind() gets the reference like below:\n\n// llcp_sock_bind()\n\n    local = nfc_llcp_find_local(dev); // A\n    ..... \\\n           | raceable\n    ..... /\n    llcp_sock->local = nfc_llcp_local_get(local); // B\n\nThere is an apparent race window that one can  drop the reference\nand free the local object fetched in (A) before (B) gets the reference.\n\n2. Some callers of the nfc_llcp_find_local() do not grab the reference\nat all. For example, the nfc_genl_llc_{{get/set}_params/sdreq} functions.\nWe add the nfc_llcp_local_put() for them. Moreover, we add the necessary\nerror handling function to put the reference.\n\n3. Add the nfc_llcp_remove_local() helper. The local object is removed\nfrom the linked list in local_release() when all reference is gone. This\npatch removes it when nfc_llcp_unregister_device() is called.\n\nTherefore, every caller of nfc_llcp_find_local() will get a reference\neven when the nfc_llcp_unregister_device() is called. This promises no\nuse-after-free for the local object is ever possible.\n\nFixes: 52feb444a903 (\"NFC: Extend netlink interface for LTO, RW, and MIUX parameters support\")\nFixes: c7aa12252f51 (\"NFC: Take a reference on the LLCP local pointer when creating a socket\")\nSigned-off-by: Lin Ma <linma@zju.edu.cn>\nReviewed-by: Simon Horman <simon.horman@corigine.com>\nSigned-off-by: David S.

But there is no function to cancel tx_sim_timer\nin ene_remove(), the timer handler ene_tx_irqsim() could race\nwith ene_remove(). As a result, the UAF bugs could happen,\nthe process is shown below.\n\n    (cleanup routine)          |        (timer routine)\n                               | mod_timer(&dev->tx_sim_timer, ..)\nene_remove()                   | (wait a time)\n                               | ene_tx_irqsim()\n                               |   dev->hw_lock //USE\n                               |   ene_tx_sample(dev) //USE\n\nFix by adding del_timer_sync(&dev->tx_sim_timer) in ene_remove(),\nThe tx_sim_timer could stop before ene device is deallocated.\n\nWhat's more, The rc_unregister_device() and del_timer_sync()\nshould be called first in ene_remove() and the deallocated\nfunctions such as free_irq(), release_region() and so on\nshould be called behind them. Because the rc_unregister_device()\nis well synchronized. Otherwise, race conditions may happen. The\nsituations that may lead to race conditions are shown below.\n\nFirstly, the rx receiver is disabled with ene_rx_disable()\nbefore rc_unregister_device() in ene_remove(), which means it\ncan be enabled again if a process opens /dev/lirc0 between\nene_rx_disable() and rc_unregister_device().\n\nSecondly, the irqaction descriptor is freed by free_irq()\nbefore the rc device is unregistered, which means irqaction\ndescriptor may be accessed again after it is deallocated.\n\nThirdly, the timer can call ene_tx_sample() that can write\nto the io ports, which means the io ports could be accessed\nagain after they are deallocated by release_region().\n\nTherefore, the rc_unregister_device() and del_timer_sync()\nshould be called first in ene_remove().\n\nSuggested by: Sean Young <sean@mess.org>\n\nFixes: 9ea53b74df9c (\"V4L/DVB: STAGING: remove lirc_ene0100 driver\")\nSigned-off-by: Duoming Zhou <duoming@zju.edu.cn>\nSigned-off-by: Sean Young <sean@mess.org>\nSigned-off-by: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@kernel.org>",

            "commit_message": "ax25: improve the incomplete fix to avoid UAF and NPD bugs\n\nThe previous commit 1ade48d0c27d (\"ax25: NPD bug when detaching\nAX25 device\") introduce lock_sock() into ax25_kill_by_device to\nprevent NPD bug. But the concurrency NPD or UAF bug will occur,\nwhen lock_sock() or release_sock() dereferences the ax25_cb->sock.\n\nThe NULL pointer dereference bug can be shown as below:\n\nax25_kill_by_device()        | ax25_release()\n                             |   ax25_destroy_socket()\n                             |     ax25_cb_del()\n  ...                        |     ...\n                             |     ax25->sk=NULL;\n  lock_sock(s->sk); //(1)    |\n  s->ax25_dev = NULL;        |     ...\n  release_sock(s->sk); //(2) |\n  ...                        |\n\nThe root cause is that the sock is set to null before dereference\nsite (1) or (2). Therefore, this patch extracts the ax25_cb->sock\nin advance, and uses ax25_list_lock to protect it, which can synchronize\nwith ax25_cb_del() and ensure the value of sock is not null before\ndereference sites.\n\nThe concurrency UAF bug can be shown as below:\n\nax25_kill_by_device()        | ax25_release()\n                             |   ax25_destroy_socket()\n  ...                        |   ...\n                             |   sock_put(sk); //FREE\n  lock_sock(s->sk); //(1)    |\n  s->ax25_dev = NULL;        |   ...\n  release_sock(s->sk); //(2) |\n  ...                        |\n\nThe root cause is that the sock is released before dereference\nsite (1) or (2). Therefore, this patch uses sock_hold() to increase\nthe refcount of sock and uses ax25_list_lock to protect it, which\ncan synchronize with ax25_cb_del() in ax25_destroy_socket() and\nensure the sock wil not be released before dereference sites.\n\nSigned-off-by: Duoming Zhou <duoming@zju.edu.cn>\nSigned-off-by: David S.

But this is not guaranteed,\nand Andrey Konovalov used the syzkaller fuzzer with KASAN to get a\nslab-out-of-bounds error by violating this assumption.\n\nThis patch fixes the bug by making uas_find_uas_alt_setting() return a\npointer to the altsetting entry rather than either the value or the\nindex.

The reproducer is basically:\n  int s = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_RAW, NEXTHDR_HOP);\n  send(s, &one_byte_of_data, 1, MSG_MORE);\n  send(s, &more_than_mtu_bytes_data, 2000, 0);\n\nThe socket() call sets the nexthdr field of the v6 header to\nNEXTHDR_HOP, the first send call primes the payload with a non zero\nbyte of data, and the second send call triggers the fragmentation path.\n\nThe fragmentation code tries to parse the header options in order\nto figure out where to insert the fragment option.  Since nexthdr points\nto an invalid option, the calculation of the size of the network header\ncan made to be much larger than the linear section of the skb and data\nis read outside of it.\n\nThis fix makes ip6_find_1stfrag return an error if it detects\nrunning out-of-bounds.\n\n[   42.361487] ==================================================================\n[   42.364412] BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in ip6_fragment+0x11c8/0x3730\n[   42.365471] Read of size 840 at addr ffff88000969e798 by task ip6_fragment-oo/3789\n[   42.366469]\n[   42.366696] CPU: 1 PID: 3789 Comm: ip6_fragment-oo Not tainted 4.11.0+ #41\n[   42.367628] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.10.1-1ubuntu1 04/01/2014\n[   42.368824] Call Trace:\n[   42.369183]  dump_stack+0xb3/0x10b\n[   42.369664]  print_address_description+0x73/0x290\n[   42.370325]  kasan_report+0x252/0x370\n[   42.370839]  ? ip6_fragment+0x11c8/0x3730\n[   42.371396]  check_memory_region+0x13c/0x1a0\n[   42.371978]  memcpy+0x23/0x50\n[   42.372395]  ip6_fragment+0x11c8/0x3730\n[   42.372920]  ? nf_ct_expect_unregister_notifier+0x110/0x110\n[   42.373681]  ? ip6_copy_metadata+0x7f0/0x7f0\n[   42.374263]  ? ip6_forward+0x2e30/0x2e30\n[   42.374803]  ip6_finish_output+0x584/0x990\n[   42.375350]  ip6_output+0x1b7/0x690\n[   42.375836]  ? ip6_finish_output+0x990/0x990\n[   42.376411]  ? ip6_fragment+0x3730/0x3730\n[   42.376968]  ip6_local_out+0x95/0x160\n[   42.377471]  ip6_send_skb+0xa1/0x330\n[   42.377969]  ip6_push_pending_frames+0xb3/0xe0\n[   42.378589]  rawv6_sendmsg+0x2051/0x2db0\n[   42.379129]  ? rawv6_bind+0x8b0/0x8b0\n[   42.379633]  ? _copy_from_user+0x84/0xe0\n[   42.380193]  ? debug_check_no_locks_freed+0x290/0x290\n[   42.380878]  ? ___sys_sendmsg+0x162/0x930\n[   42.381427]  ? rcu_read_lock_sched_held+0xa3/0x120\n[   42.382074]  ? sock_has_perm+0x1f6/0x290\n[   42.382614]  ? ___sys_sendmsg+0x167/0x930\n[   42.383173]  ? lock_downgrade+0x660/0x660\n[   42.383727]  inet_sendmsg+0x123/0x500\n[   42.384226]  ? inet_sendmsg+0x123/0x500\n[   42.384748]  ? inet_recvmsg+0x540/0x540\n[   42.385263]  sock_sendmsg+0xca/0x110\n[   42.385758]  SYSC_sendto+0x217/0x380\n[   42.386249]  ?
